be careful about subset (子集) and proper-subset (真子集)
Empty set ∅ is unique
A − (B ∪ C) = (A − B) ∩ (A − C)

A − (B ∩ C) = (A − B) ∪ (A − C)
Generalized Union (广义并) and Generalized Intersection (广义交).
For technical reason, we define ∪ ∅ = ∅, but ∩ ∅ is undefined
power set (幂集)
the power set is always non-empty
2 A always has “more” elements than that of A.
2 A ∈ 2 B ⇒ A ∈ B
A ⊆ B ⇔ 2 A ⊆ 2 B
2 A ∩ 2 B = 2A∩B
2 A ∪ 2 B ⊆ 2 A∪B

Let A be a family of sets. Then A is said to be a transitive set if any element of

an element in A is still an element in A, i.e.,

(∀x)(∀y)((y ∈ A ∧ x ∈ y) → x ∈ A)
if x ∈ A, then x ⊆ A.
