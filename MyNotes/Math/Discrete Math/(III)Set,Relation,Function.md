be careful about subset (子集) and proper-subset (真子集)
Empty set ∅ is unique
A − (B ∪ C) = (A − B) ∩ (A − C)

A − (B ∩ C) = (A − B) ∪ (A − C)
Generalized Union (广义并) and Generalized Intersection (广义交).
For technical reason, we define ∪ ∅ = ∅, but ∩ ∅ is undefined
power set (幂集)
the power set is always non-empty
2 A always has “more” elements than that of A.
