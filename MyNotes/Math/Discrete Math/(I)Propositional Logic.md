A proposition is a declarative sentence/assertion that is either true or false(but not both).
Those propositions that cannot be further decomposed are called atomic propositions (原子命题)
Those propositions composed by multiple atomic propositions and logical operators, such
as “if snow is black, then 1 + 1 = 3”, are called compound propositions (复合命题).
