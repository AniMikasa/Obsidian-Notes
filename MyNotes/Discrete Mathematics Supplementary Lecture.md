Formal Verification and Synthesis for Dynamical Systems(A Temporal-Logic-Based Approach)

## What is Dynamical System

{
D: 
\begin{cases} 
x_{t+1} = f(x_t, u_t, w_t) \\ 
y_t = g(x_t, u_t, v_t)
\end{cases}
}

## Continuous-Time Dynamical System
\[
D: 
\begin{cases} 
\dot{x}(t) = f(x(t), u(t), w(t)) \\ 
y(t) = g(x(t), u(t), v(t))
\end{cases}
\]

### Key Points:
- ✓ The system has a state space that may contain an infinite number of states.  
- ✓ The evolution of the state is determined by a dynamic function.
